<h2>Evaluation of Sabletine Fine Pastries <a href="https://sabletine.com" target="_blank">sabletine.com</a></h2>
<ol>
    <li>The site is very simple. It's not cluttered, and it has straightforward navigation via headers above each page's content, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li>The site organizes it's flow of information via mentioned top header. An ad also promotes ordering via their Shopify page, linking visitors there upon click. Other content is linked across the page as well. The page is not overwhelmed with content, and more detailed information (such as contact information and products) is conveyed via subpages.</li>
    <li>The site structure is straightforward enough. Not much to be confused about, it is relatively bare bones; no  clutter.</li>
    <li>I'd say that the graphics enhance the experience. With maybe just one too many ads for their Shopify page, the site was nothing like the clutter that is <a href="https://www.jamilin.com/" target="_blank">jamilin.com</a></li>
    <li>Load time is extremely reasonable. Nothing too intense on the site.</li>
    <li>The text color and size are readable as well. The font choice suits the website; it isn’t a Serif font, but it’s still quite readable. Background color is either a default white or a cream.</li>
<li>The site features a top horizontal navigation bar for main pages. Simple and effective.</li>
<li>Design elements such as font and choice place of image captions does remain consistent throughout the site.</li>
<li>Resizing (and small screen sizes) are where the site design seems to fall flat. Resizing my window didn’t adjust the content at all. If it was shrunk too far horizontally, I’d have to horizontally scroll to view the full page.</li>
<li>I’ll mention the odd caption placement as something that’s a bit unusual. For the pages on the different pastries and products sold by Sabletine, the caption describing image of said food shifts the body of the page left. It looks a bit off and may have looked better right under the image. Certainly a designer’s choice, and not too big a deal. Caption placement is difficult!</li>
